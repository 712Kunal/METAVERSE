            <div class="text-box">
            <p>Cybercrime is any criminal activity that involves a computer, networked device or a network.

                While most cybercrimes are carried out in order to generate profit for the cybercriminals, some cybercrimes are carried out against computers or devices directly to damage or disable them. Others use computers or networks to spread malware, illegal information, images or other materials. Some cybercrimes do both -- i.e., target computers to infect them with a computer virus, which is then spread to other machines and, sometimes, entire networks.</p>

                        Document Evidence: Gather any relevant information or evidence related to the cybercrime, such as screenshots, emails, or any other digital records that can support your report.
                        Contact Law Enforcement: Report the incident to your local law enforcement agency or cybercrime reporting unit. They can provide guidance on how to proceed and investigate the matter further.

                        Report to Cybersecurity Authorities: In addition to local law enforcement, consider reporting the cybercrime to relevant cybersecurity authorities or organizations that specialize in handling digital threats.
                        Seek Legal Advice: If the cybercrime involves financial loss or significant damage, consider seeking legal advice to understand your rights and options for recourse.
